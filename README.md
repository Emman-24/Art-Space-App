# Art Space App

Art Space is a digital art gallery app that allows users to showcase a variety of artwork. This app was created as part of a learning project to apply the concepts learned in a coding course. Unlike previous guided exercises, this project encourages independent development with minimal instructions, allowing for more creative freedom.
